This is a key-chain voice recorder which uses RP2040-Zero as a microcontroller. It uses INMP441 microphone module to record decent audio. It also uses a Micro-SD card reader to append and read the audios.

## Why I made this project?

<div>

I am a very big fan of crime documentories and shows that forces you to think. So I always though what can I do in a situation like a threat or a fight that could get you in trouble, later. And yeah its simple just carry a voice recorder (for ethical use only) that can record audio whenever you want.

## Features

* The recorder is powered by battery so its very compatible with transportations.

* The ON/OFF is done by slide switch added on the side of the body.

* You have pushbutton that takes morse code as password for you to start recording.
For you- ''Decode the password that can be anywhere in anyway inside this repo!!''

* The sound quality is decently good since we are using INMP441 module.

In future there might be new features(maybe a speaker or even cooler case)!!

Here are few reference you might want to take a look on (full resource included in the folders above)-
